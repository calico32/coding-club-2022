We want a bank system that will allow users to create an account, withdraw/deposit money, and check their account balance in any language you would like. Of course, this isnâ€™t real money but just a simulation of putting in and out. This project will be worth 5 points, but there are extra points available to get with a total of 10 points possible.

Write code such that person can:

- Create Account
- Withdraw and deposit money
- Check Account Balance
- Takes in real-time user input

Bonus:

- Create a verification id to access the account (+1 point)
- Make a graphical design of your bank (+4 points)
