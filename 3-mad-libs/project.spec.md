The project this week is to create a mad-libs program that allows the user to fill in the blanks of a story. You will have to make the templates for these stories along with handling user input. This project is worth 5 points.

Write code such that user can:

- Fill in the blanks for a template story provided
- Display the final story with the filled-in words
- Label or suggest the type of word that should be filled in (ex. Verb or Adjective)

Bonus:

- Allow the user to pick and choose multiple mad-libs stories (+2 points):
- Create a graphical interface (+2 points)
- Added creativity (type in private comments what feature was added that went beyond the guidelines of the challenge) (+1 point)
