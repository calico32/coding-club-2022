Hi everyone, just to clarify this challenge, we have given you a set of numbers and whether they are valid or not. Figure out what the pattern between the numbers is manually and what makes them valid or invalid(Hint: addition will be useful here). Then write a program in the language of your choice that takes a 10 digit number as its input and outputs whether it is valid or not using the pattern you figured out in the numbers.

UPDATE: Separate the first 8 numbers from the last 2 numbers to find the pattern. Remember addition is useful.

1. 92665014 33 - Valid Number
2. 97048572 94 - Invalid Number
3. 07592742 36 - Valid Number
4. 11284927 46 - Invalid Number
5. 03918392 74 - Invalid Number
6. 94204727 35 - Valid Number
7. 98989674 60 - Valid Number
8. 03840748 20 - Invalid Number
9. 09858155 41 - Valid Number
